  <p class="aboutpara">
    I graduated in 2016 from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences and a minor in Biological Sciences. I had always planned on working with animals and devoting my career to learning more about them and how to help them. After years of frustrating and misleading jobs, I decided to change things up.

    <span>Enter: SavvyCoders.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    I applied to SavvyCoders with little to no knowledge of coding, and an overwhelming desire to change my career. Throughout this program, I learned to really love and become passionate about web development. I have always had a knack for technology and computers but completing this bootcamp gave me the skills I needed to begin my career as a developer.
