<p class="aboutpara">I graduated in 2016 from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences and a minor in Biological Sciences. I had always planned on working with animals and devoting my career to learning more about them and how to help them. After years of frustrating misleading jobs, I decided to change things up. Enter: SavvyCoders. I applied to SavvyCoders with little to no knowledge of coding, and an overwhelming desire to change my career. Throughout this program, I learned to love coding and am eager to begin my new career in web application development </p>
